                <h1>A 20th century inventor and visionary</h1>
                <p>Dedicating his life to making the world work for all of humanity, Fuller operated as a practical philosopher who demonstrated his ideas as inventions. Fuller did not limit himself to one field but worked as a 'comprehensive anticipatory design scientist' to solve global problems surrounding housing, shelter, transportation, education, energy, ecological destruction, and poverty.</p>

Instead, he vows to use his life an experiment aimed at discovering what an average, healthy individual (albeit penniless and with a family to support) can do in service of all humanity. He enters a period of deep introspection, absorbed in study and meditation, speaking to almost nobody for two years. His second daughter, Allegra, is born in Chicago. Fuller founds the 4D Company to research and develop his ideas for the super-light and efficient 4D house and car.</p>
